Exploring using Windows' Raw Input API for collecting mouse and keyboard data.

These can work simultaneously, don't seem to interfere with regular usage, ...

TODO:
  - multiple mice/keyboards
  - pumping more than one message at a time?
  - Look at jitter for HID through this vs. through HIDAPI (which uses a slightly different mechanism)
